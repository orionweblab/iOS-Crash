# iOS-Crash
Crash iOS with a webpage. It's really easy, open the webpage in safari on iOS and simply press the crash button. This will proceed to crash iOS.

# Demo
Here is the demo: ~~http://KuNet.party/crash/~~ Demo has been shut down perm.

# Installation
Just put the index.html just wherever (you don't need the plist unless you change the url in the index file) on a webserver.

# Misc
Just so you know, sometimes it takes longer on some devices to crash. If a popup pops up, try scrolling down.
One more thing, you can also add to homescreen.
